GUJRAT Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
 typesetting industry. GUJRAT Ipsum has been the industry's
  standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
  printer GUJRAT took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
  specimen book. It has survived GUJRAT not only five centuries,
   but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
   essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s GUJRAT
   with the GUJRAT release of Letraset sheets containing GUJRAT Ipsum passages, 
   and more recently with desktop publishing software 
like GUJRAT Aldus PageMaker including GUJRAT versions of GUJRAT Ipsum
